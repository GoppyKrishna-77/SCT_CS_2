# üñºÔ∏è Image Encryption Tool

This project is a **simple image encryption tool** that manipulates pixels in an image to encrypt it. The tool supports two operations:
- **Swapping Pixel Values**: Randomly swaps pixel positions.
- **Adding a Value to Pixels**: Applies a mathematical operation to each pixel by increasing its RGB values.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Swap Pixels**: Randomly exchanges pixel positions to obfuscate the image.
- **Add Value to Pixels**: Adds a user-specified value to each pixel's RGB components while maintaining valid pixel ranges (0-255).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `Pillow` library (`pip install pillow`)

### üîß How to Use
1. Place your image file in the samples folder.
2. Run the script:
```bash
python encrypt_image.py
```
3. Choose an operation:
- swap: Randomly swaps pixel values.
- add: Adds a specified value to the RGB components of each pixel.
4. When prompted, enter a value between 0-255 for the add operation.
5. The encrypted image will be saved in the outputs folder as encrypted_image.png.
